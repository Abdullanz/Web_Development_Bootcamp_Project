# YelpCamp_Project
The YelpCamp Project was the major project for The Web Developer Bootcamp By Colt Steele in Udemy. I worked on this version, which is a bit modified from the original and I turned it to Arabic while working on the project to improve my Front-End skills.

I learned a lot while working on this project. Specifically, Server-Side Development, User-Authentication, User-Authorization, Embedded JavaScript and much more. I also liked working on nodeJS, and npm libraries because it provides an amazing resources for developers to deploy a project.
